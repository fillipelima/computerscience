/**
 * 
 * Consider a big party where N guests came to it and a log register for guestâ€™s
 * entry and exit times was maintained. Find the minimum time at which there
 * were maximum guests at the party. Note that entries in the register are not
 * in any order.
 * 
 * Note: Guests are leaving after the exit times.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * Input: N = 5 Entry= {1, 2,10, 5, 5} Exit = {4, 5, 12, 9, 12} Output: 3 5
 * Explanation: At time 5 there were guest number 2, 4 and 5 present.
